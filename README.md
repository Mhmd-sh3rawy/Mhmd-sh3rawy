## 🧑‍💻 About Me

Hi there! I’m Mohammed, a self-driven engineering student from Egypt passionate about bridging hardware and AI. I spend my time learning analog/digital IC design, exploring AI/ML, and building practical embedded systems. I thrive on understanding the “how” behind tech—whether it's compilers, circuits, or neural networks—and I’m working towards building tools that make design smarter and more efficient.
